# Day 2 Assignment — Django Apps & URL Routing

## What You're Building

Starting from your Day 1 `todo_project`, you'll create a `tasks` app and wire up three routes: **Home**, **About**, and **Contact** — each with its own view and a named URL.

This is the foundation the rest of the to-do app will be built on top of in later days.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Create and register the `tasks` app
- Run `python manage.py startapp tasks` inside your project.
- Add `'tasks'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

### 2. Build three views
In `tasks/views.py`, write three function-based views:
- `home` — returns a response for the homepage.
- `about` — returns a response describing the app.
- `contact` — returns a response with some way to get in touch (a placeholder is fine).

You can use `HttpResponse` directly for now — templates aren't required until Day 4.

### 3. Wire up named URL routes
In `tasks/urls.py`, create three `path()` entries, each with a `name`:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),
]
```

### 4. Connect `tasks/urls.py` to the project
In your project's main `urls.py` (next to `settings.py`), include the tasks app's URLs:
```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('tasks.urls')),
]
```

### 5. Confirm it all runs
- `python manage.py runserver`
- Visit `/`, `/about/`, and `/contact/` and confirm each loads without errors.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] `tasks` app created via `startapp` and registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`
- [ ] `home`, `about`, and `contact` views exist in `tasks/views.py`
- [ ] `tasks/urls.py` defines all three routes with `name=` set
- [ ] Project's root `urls.py` includes `tasks.urls`
- [ ] Server runs with no errors; all three routes return a working page
- [ ] Commit history shows your progress (not one giant commit)
- [ ] README updated with a short note on what `name=` does for a URL and why it's useful

## Homework Questions (answer in your README)

1. In your own words, explain the difference between a project and an app.
2. What command creates a new Django app?
3. Why do we register an app inside `INSTALLED_APPS`?
4. What does giving a URL a `name=` actually let you do later?

---

## Autograding

This repo includes automated checks (`.github/workflows/classroom.yml`) that verify:
- the `tasks` app exists and is registered
- `python manage.py check` passes
- all three named routes resolve and return a successful response
- no virtual environment was committed

These checks cover the mechanical parts of the assignment. Your README explanations and homework answers are graded separately by your instructor.
